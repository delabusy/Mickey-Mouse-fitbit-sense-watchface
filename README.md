# Mickey-Mouse-fitbit-sense-watchface 

I wanted a mickey mouse watchface like I've seen on other devices, apparently there isn't one in the fitbit store for regulatory/copyright issues. Soooo here's mine! lol 

**Basics:**
- The watch features a combination of images to complete a 'Mickey Mouse', it's arms spin according to the time. There's a seconds hand.. 
- The only displayed items are roman numerals for '12','3',9'. They display at all times at their places on the watchface accordingly.

**Extra Information** 
When specific watchface areas are tapped more information displays. ALL 3 are displayed irregardless of which was tapped. 
The extra information will display and then slowly disappear in 20-25 seconds. 
- The bottom '6 o' clock' position under the shoes displays the steps counter in yellow. 
- The top left corner position shows HeartRate in red, tilted 45 degrees. 
- The top right corner position shows the battery percentage in grey, tilted -45 degrees.

Will elaborate on process, and future dev later. A lot of this process was started by someone else so I'll post a reference once I find it again.

## Planned Ideas:
- Initially planned on having the background 'pulse' dependant on the HeartRate frequency, but it looked odd..... so re-think this maybe.
- Make the cartoon 'hands/arms' outlined and display them for 'always on' display use.
- Minnie Mouse version
- flip watch for lefties
- Keeping the "6" roman numeral active, then making it disappear when the other information appears (reversing the fade process).
- Extra information spins in? for extra cuteness?
- What other information can/should be displayed and how?
- Different outfits/looks.
  - Red/bloodshot eyes at 4:20am/pm
  - Sleepy eyes between 1:00am and 7:00am
  - Weather API
    - if it's rainy make him wear a raincoat
    - if it's over 80*F.. IDK something
    - if it's under 28*F.. IDK something
- color bars?
- Okay but what if the seconds hand was a lil white pee pee and it spun from his crotch?


- Creating a settings option/interface 
  - to change the numerals
  - apply new images to 'body', 'hour arm/hand', 'minute arm/hand'
  - change display of seconds bar (color)
- How to package and put on watchface store with non copyrighted images, then host the 'mickey' images for folks to download or use for free. Also lets folks design their own.

# Mickey-Mouse-fitbit-sense-watchface 

I wanted a mickey mouse watchface like I've seen on other devices, apparently there isn't one in the fitbit store for regulatory/copyright issues. Soooo here's mine! lol 

**Basics:**
- The watch features a combination of images to complete a 'Mickey Mouse', it's arms spin according to the time. There's a seconds hand.. 
- The only displayed items are roman numerals for '12','3',9'. They display at all times at their places on the watchface accordingly.

**Extra Information** 
When specific watchface areas are tapped more information displays. ALL 3 are displayed irregardless of which was tapped. 
The extra information will display and then slowly disappear in 20-25 seconds. 
- The bottom '6 o' clock' position under the shoes displays the steps counter in yellow. 
- The top left corner position shows HeartRate in red, tilted 45 degrees. 
- The top right corner position shows the battery percentage in grey, tilted -45 degrees.


Will elaborate on process, and future dev later. 

## Planned Ideas:
- Different outfits/looks.
  - Red/bloodshot eyes at 4:20am/pm
  - Sleepy eyes between 1:00am and 7:00am
  - Weather API
    - if it's rainy make him wear a raincoat
    - if it's over 80*F.. IDK something
    - if it's under 28*F.. IDK something
- color bars? Spinn
- Okay but what if the seconds hand was a lil white pee pee and it spun from his crotch?
